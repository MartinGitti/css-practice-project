## Further practice using css styling methods to add to a html page.

* This project is another look at working with CSS styling to HTML pages.

Page example 1:

<img src="screenshots-of-page/htmlPage1.JPG" alt="View of HTML page 1">
<img src="screenshots-of-page/htmlPage2.JPG" alt="View of HTML page 2">

## Use of the code for the HTML pages above:
<p>Think of CSS as clothing for a human, it has all to do with style and layout of a Web Page.</p>
<p>In order to use the code, open it via a browser once the files are on your local drive.</p>
<p>In order to edit the code, i'd recommend using text editor like Sublime Text or Visual Studio Code.</p>
<p>Please feel free to make use of the code.</p>
